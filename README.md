# LViT-Language-Meets-Vision-Transformer-in-Medical-Image-Segmentation
LViT (Language meets Vision Transformer), that integrates natural language understanding with vision transformers for medical image segmentation. By combining visual features from CT scans with textual semantic information, LViT improves segmentation accuracy and generalization compared to traditional CNN and ViT-based models
